# Orus Playground

Try out the Orus programming language right in your browser. No installation needed!

The playground allows you to experiment with Orus code and see the results immediately. Write and test your code, then share it with others using the "Share" button.

For more complex projects or collaborative work, check out [OrusPad](/pad/) which provides real-time collaboration features.
