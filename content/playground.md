# Online Playground

The Orus online playground allows you to write and run Orus code directly in your browser without installing anything on your system. It's perfect for quickly testing features or sharing code snippets with others.

## Features

- **Code Editor** with syntax highlighting specifically for Orus
- **Instant Execution** of your Orus code in a sandboxed environment
- **Example Library** with code samples demonstrating key Orus features
- **Shareable URLs** to easily send your code to others
- **Code Formatting** to keep your code clean and consistent

## Getting Started

1. Visit the [playground](/playground)
2. Choose an example from the dropdown or write your own code
3. Click the "Run" button to see your code in action
4. Use the "Share" feature to generate a URL with your code

## Limitations

The online playground provides a simplified execution environment for educational purposes. For more complex projects or production use, we recommend [installing Orus](/install) on your local machine.
