# Announcing Orus 0.1.0

We're excited to announce the first public release of the Orus programming language! After months of development, Orus 0.1.0 is now available for developers to try out.

## What is Orus?

Orus is a modern programming language designed with three primary goals:

1. **Performance**: Orus is designed for speed, with a focus on efficient compilation and runtime performance.
2. **Reliability**: Strong typing, memory safety without garbage collection, and a clear error handling system.
3. **Developer Productivity**: Expressive syntax, powerful abstractions, and excellent tooling.

## Key Features in 0.1.0

- Core language syntax and semantics
- Basic standard library
- Compiler with helpful error messages
- Simple build system
- Documentation and getting started guides

## Example

Here's a simple example of Orus code:

```orus
// A simple function to calculate fibonacci numbers
fn fibonacci(n: u64) -> u64 {
    if n <= 1 {
        return n;
    }
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}

fn main() {
    // Calculate and print the first 10 fibonacci numbers
    for i in 0..10 {
        println("fibonacci({}) = {}", i, fibonacci(i));
    }
}
```

## Getting Started
