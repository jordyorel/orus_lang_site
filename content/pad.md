# OrusPad

OrusPad is an experimental collaborative editor for the Orus language. It lets you share a session with others in real time, similar to the Rustpad project.

Click the **Start Session** button to begin collaborating. A link will be generated that you can share with friends. All participants will see each other's cursor and edits instantly.

> **Note:** OrusPad relies on TogetherJS's public infrastructure. For production use, consider hosting your own instance.

Enjoy experimenting with Orus code together!
